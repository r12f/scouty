# Status Bar

## Overview

The status bar occupies the bottom 2 lines, providing data overview (density chart + position) on line 1 and interactive state (mode/input/messages) on line 2.


## Design

### Line 1: Data Overview

- **Left**: Braille density chart (Unicode U+2800-U+28FF), adaptive width
- **Right**: `1,234/5,678 (Total: 10,000)`
- Density chart shows filtered log time distribution; each braille char = 2×4 dot matrix
- Current cursor position highlighted in the density chart (yellow)

### Density Chart Time-Per-Column Label

Display a time-per-column label to the left of the density chart on line 1, showing the time span each braille column represents.

**Format:** `[█=Xs]` where X is dynamically computed as `(max_ts - min_ts) / num_buckets`, then snapped up to the nearest standard interval.

**Time snapping:** The raw computed duration per column is rounded **up** to the nearest value in the following progression:
- Seconds: 0, 5, 15, 30
- Minutes: 0, 5, 15, 30
- Hours: 1, 2, 6, 12, 24

For example: raw 3s → snap to 5s, raw 8s → snap to 15s, raw 20s → snap to 30s, raw 40s → snap to 1m, raw 3m → snap to 5m, raw 8m → snap to 15m, raw 45m → snap to 1h.

The number of buckets should be adjusted accordingly so that the chart covers the full time range with the snapped interval.

**Unit auto-selection:**
- < 1s → ms (e.g., `[█=500ms]`)
- 1s to < 60s → s (e.g., `[█=5s]`)
- 1m to < 60m → m (e.g., `[█=2m]`)
- ≥ 60m → h (e.g., `[█=1h]`)

**Layout:** `[█=5s]⣿⣷⣶⣤⣀⣿⣷⣶  42/100 (Total: 500)`

**Behavior:**
- Label width is deducted from density chart available width
- Hidden when no data or only one timestamp exists
- Visually distinguishable from chart (e.g., dimmer color)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Label displayed left of density chart in `[█=time]` format
- [ ] Time unit dynamically computed and auto-selected (ms/s/m/h)
- [ ] Time per column snapped up to nearest standard interval (5/15/30 for s and m)
- [ ] Label width deducted from chart width, no layout overflow
- [ ] Hidden when insufficient data

### Line 2: Interactive State (Three Mutually Exclusive Modes)

**Mode A — Default (shortcut hints):**
```
[VIEW] /: Search │ f: Filter │ -: Exclude │ =: Include │ Enter: Detail │ ?: Help
```

**Mode B — Input mode:**
```
[SEARCH] pattern█    [FILTER] level == "Error"█    [GOTO] 1234█
```
Triggered by `/`, `f`, `-`, `=`, `Ctrl+G`, `h`, `:`. Esc/Enter exits input.

**Mode C — Temporary status message:**
```
Copied to clipboard    Filter applied: 5,678 records    No matches found
```
Auto-clears after 3 seconds or on next keypress.

### Mode Label Colors

- `[VIEW]` — default
- `[FOLLOW]` — green/cyan
- `[SEARCH]`/`[FILTER]`/`[EXCLUDE]`/`[INCLUDE]`/`[GOTO]` — yellow

### Density Chart Caching

The density chart is **cached** and only recomputed when:
- Filter conditions change (filtered_indices version change)
- Window width changes (bucket count changes)

Navigation (j/k/PageUp/PageDown/g/G) does **not** trigger recomputation. Only the cursor highlight position is updated per frame (O(log N) binary search on cached time range).

## Performance

- Navigation must be < 16ms/frame (60fps target)
- Cache overhead: < 1KB (buckets array + braille string)
